Impress-tutorial

\section{Project Description}

If you search for tutorial on any subject on the net. You will probably encounter a blog post with lots of information in text is thrown at you. This is not particularly a good and effective measure to present information to new-comers due to Human Nature of attention span.

So, we want to make it better. Our tutorial will be displayed on a step by step basis. So you will know exactly what you need to do. A task you will be performing will be thus be divided into multiple steps and thus multiple achievement keeping the viewer interested. 

\section{Objective}

The major Objective of this project is to change the way tutorial is written in the world wide web. We try to enhance E-learners experience by presenting the tutorial in step by step fashion such that users dont get overwhelm by the large amount of information but can focus on immediate task he need to achieve. 

\section{Project Methodology}

This project utilises the new html 5 features of canvas and the javascript tool to create a presentation like format of the tutorial.

\section{Project Output}

Our Web-Application ultimately outputs a .html file which with required javascript linkage and css linkage so that it looks like a step by step presentation.

\section{Remarks}

We would like to thank to people who have created 

1. impress.js
2. tinymce

We have utilised their code and without them this project would not have been sucessful.
